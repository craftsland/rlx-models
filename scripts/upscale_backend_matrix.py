"""Which backends can run each rlx-upscale architecture, decided statically.

"Does DRCT run on ROCm?" is answerable from the op set alone — no ROCm box
required — because the compiler fails a graph that needs an op the target
cannot reach. But *reach* is not the same as *claim*: an op is runnable on a
backend by any of three routes, and a matrix that only reads `SUPPORTED_OPS`
reports false gaps for the other two.

  1. the backend claims it in `SUPPORTED_OPS`
  2. the legalize loop in `rlx-compile/src/rewrite.rs` has an explicit lowering
     that fires when the target does not claim it (`Pad`, `Roll`, `Slice`, …)
  3. the op carries `OpCaps::FUSED` in `rlx-ir/src/capability.rs`, so the
     unfuse pass decomposes it into primitives (`SelectiveScan`, `Lstm`, …)

Routes 2 and 3 are deliberate: CoreML, for instance, leaves `SelectiveScan`
*unclaimed on purpose* so the rewriter produces the compact `Op::Scan` form,
because Apple's compiler is superlinear in program size. Reading only the claim
set would call that a gap when it is a considered optimization.

This reads the op set from `cargo run --example op_coverage --json` and all
three support sources from the RLX tree, then prints the matrix and the precise
residue for every genuinely red cell.

`--check` is a *regression* guard, not a demand that every cell be green. Some
gaps are known and deliberate — an int8/fp16 NPU has no FP32 datapath, so an
f32 upscaler was never going to run there. Those are listed in `EXPECTED_GAPS`
and `NOT_AN_F32_TARGET`; anything outside them fails.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/upscale_backend_matrix.py                 # matrix
  python3 scripts/upscale_backend_matrix.py --check         # exit 1 on a NEW gap
  python3 scripts/upscale_backend_matrix.py --rlx ../rlx    # tree location
