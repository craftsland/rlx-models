Greedy decode initially tracked the reference for only ~6 tokens before
flipping a near-tie and looping. That was **not** this port: three
`rlx-qwen35` bugs (prompt padding advancing the GDN scan, the short-conv
window exported from the padding, and a `predict_logits` that returned
position 0) — all now fixed, and pinned by
`crates/rlx-qwen35/tests/decode_equivalence.rs`. Plain `Qwen3.8-27B-Q3_K_S`
was affected identically and is fixed with it.

# rlx-models parity / speed / memory ledger

Tracks the three acceptance criteria for native-rlx inference vs the ONNX/torch
reference (`rlx_beats_onnx_criteria`): **(1) full parity** (cos≈1.0 or exact
transcript), **(2) faster** wall-time, **(3) same-or-less peak RAM**. ort/onnx is
the *reference only* — inference must be native rlx.

Legend: ✅ meets · ⚠️ close/needs measure · ❌ fails · — n/a (ort removed, no

Weights store: large (≥1 GB) trees live on `/Volumes/FOUR/weights/**` and are
symlinked back under `weights/` (internal disk was 93% full). Relocation is
byte+count verified before the original is removed — see `scripts/relocate_weight.sh`.

## Ternary Bonsai 2 27B (real-weight, vs the PrismML llama.cpp fork)

`prism-ml/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-gguf` PTQ1_0 (5.95 GB), M4 Pro / Metal, greedy.
Reference is `llama-completion` from the `prism` branch of
[PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp](https://github.com/PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp) — stock
llama.cpp cannot read these files (PTQ1_0/PQ2_0 and `prism.hadamard` are
fork-only, and `prism` is its DEFAULT branch, not `master`). Build it with
`just ref-prism-llama`; it lands in `/Volumes/FOUR/ref/prism-llama` rather than
a scratch dir, because every claim below is stated against that binary and a
session scratchpad does not survive. The recipe also builds
`llama-eval-callback`, which dumps every graph node with values and is what
located the `token_embd` inverse bug.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Greedy continuation of `"The capital of France is"`, 40 tokens | ✅ **character-for-character** vs the reference: `"Paris.\nThe capital of Germany is Berlin.\nThe capital of Italy is Rome.\nThe capital of Spain is Madrid.\nThe capital of Portugal is Lisbon.\nThe capital of the United"` |
| Prefill argmax, same prompt | ✅ token-exact: `11751 13 198 760 6511 314 9564` |
| PTQ1_0 payload on real bytes | ✅ exactly `{−d, 0, +d}`; `blk.3.attn_k` splits −1/0/+1 at 33.7 / 32.8 / 33.5 % |
| `token_embd` inverse basis | ✅ per-row kurtosis 1.51 → 8.08 (1.5 is exactly a balanced ternary's kurtosis, so the stored rows really are rotated latents) |
| All 401 folded weights transformed | ✅ 273×5120 + 64×17408 + 64×6144 per graph, 48 with the GDN head permutation |

Reproduce:

```sh
just fetch-bonsai2-27b
RLX_QWEN35_BONSAI2_GGUF=weights/lm/ternary-bonsai-2-27b-gguf/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-PTQ1_0.gguf \

  --prompt-ids "760,6511,314,9338,369" --max-tokens 7
```

**Speed: ⚠️ ~16× faster than at the start, ~2× behind the reference.**
Steady-state decode (median `total_ms` over decode steps ≥ 2,
`RLX_QWEN35_DECODE_TRACE=1`, Metal / M4 Pro), best observed:

| | tok/s | ms/token |
|---|---:|---:|
| before any fused kernel | 0.61 | 1638 |
| fused GEMV, integer digit extraction | 4.34 | 230 |
| fused GEMV, float-pipe | 8.1 | 124 |
| **+ MPS for the rotation's square GEMM** | **9.7** | **103** |
| reference (`llama-completion`) | 18.6 | 53.7 |

⚠️ **Only the ratio is trustworthy on this box.** Absolute ms/token moves by
2× with whatever else is running, and it has moved under me three times —
the reference alone has read 69, 78 and 54 ms depending on the hour. Measured
*interleaved*, the rlx : reference ratio is stable at **~2.0** (2.01, 2.02,
2.07, 2.12 under heavy load; 1.83 under light). Quote ratios, take min-of-N for
absolutes, alternate the arms of any A/B, and check
`ps -Ao pcpu,comm | sort -rn | head` first.

Three things got it here:

1. A fused `PTQ1_0` decode GEMV at all — `dequant_matmul_gguf` was **89.8%** of
   decode on the thunk profile, re-expanding every weight to f32 per token.
2. `ptq1_0_mv_f32_sg_fp`, ported from the fork's own Metal kernel: base-3 digit
   extraction rewritten into the float pipe (this ISA cannot co-issue integer
   and float work) with each thread owning whole *bytes*, so a block's bytes
   are read once rather than five times.
3. A narrow rlx-metal cost-model rule sending small-`m`, 8-unaligned, **square**
   (`k == n`) GEMMs to MPS. The rotation reshapes to `[-1, 1024]`, giving
   `m = 5/6/17` against `k = n = 1024` ~190× a token; those land on
   `SimdPadded`, which pads `m` up to a simdgroup and wastes the tile.
   Bonsai-2 111.3 → 103.2 ms, won every round. `k == n` is the discriminator
   and is not arbitrary — a square operator is a basis change, never a
   transformer projection. Verified with `RLX_METAL_SMALL_M_MPS_TRACE=1` that
   the rule fires on **no** shape in Qwen3.8-27B or Bonsai-1, so it cannot
   regress them; an earlier version without `k == n` did catch rectangular
   shapes and cost Qwen3.8 1.6%. Opt out: `RLX_METAL_NO_SMALL_M_MPS=1`.

**Where the remaining ~2× lives.** On an *unloaded* profile decode is
`dequant_matmul_gguf` **65%**, `sgemm` 13%, attention 9%, everything else under
3% — i.e. the weight-streaming GEMV dominates and there is no overhead pile to
attack. rlx streams the 5.9 GB at roughly 90 GB/s effective against the
reference's ~150; closing the gap means a better GEMV, not more fusion.

⚠️ **`RLX_METAL_THUNK_PROFILE=1` lies under load.** It runs each thunk
serialized with a full sync, so every small dispatch pays that sync and the
op mix looks completely different: the same graph profiled on a busy box
reported `concat` at 17% / 116 ms where a clean run puts it at 1.5% / 1.04 ms.
Two hours went into "concat is expensive" on the strength of a contended
profile. Check the load first, and sanity-check the summed GPU span against
wall-clock before trusting the shares.

Decode issues ~2340 GPU dispatches per token and the CPU sits at 5-55% of one
core during it, so it is GPU-bound, not encode-bound.

**Tuning the GEMV needs an idle machine, and this one has not been one.**
`ptq1_0_gemv_bandwidth` in `rlx-metal` (a `#[ignore]`d benchmark) times the
kernel alone at the 27B's real projection shapes, subtracts the fixed
per-`run()` overhead, and sweeps `RLX_METAL_PTQ1_0_NSG` with the arms
**alternated inside one process** — the only form that survives a busy box.
Run it with:

```sh
cargo test -p rlx-metal --release --test metal_gguf_dequant_matmul_prefill_parity \
    ptq1_0_gemv_bandwidth -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Measured so far, all under 2-3 concurrent CPU-saturating jobs: kernel-only
bandwidth 42-71 GB/s depending on load, with **no separable difference between
NSG 2, 4 and 8**. Sequential (non-interleaved) readings had suggested NSG=4 was
1.7x better and NSG=8 2.7x worse; both were load artifacts. The default stays
at 2, matching the sibling Q1_0/Q2_0 kernels, because an unjustified default is
worse than a boring one. Every value the flag accepts is correctness-checked by
`ptq1_0_decode_gemv_matches_cpu`.

Remaining work: a better PTQ1_0 GEMV (65% of decode; the reference implies
~150 GB/s is reachable against our ~90 on a quiet box), a fused FWHT (the
rotation is ~13% against ~3.7 GFLOP of real math), and a prefill `m > 1` GEMM.

**Peak memory: ✅ 32.2 → 23.1 GB (−28%).** Adding the fused GEMV only updated
the *run-time* dispatch (`use_fused_ptq1_0_mv` in `encode/mod.rs`); the
*compile-time* arena sizing (`dequant_gguf_scratch_bytes`) had arms for Q1_0,
Q2_0 and G8_0 but not PTQ1_0, so the arena still reserved an f32 dequant slab
the fused kernel never touches — Ternary Bonsai 2's `[248320, 5120]` head alone
is ~5 GiB of it. The two must stay in lockstep: disagree one way and the arena
reserves a slab nothing writes, the other way and the encoder needs one that
was never allocated.

**The same mmap-borrow upload exists in other crates.** `rlx-qwen3` had it in
two places and both are now `pread`-based: `high_level_runner.rs` (borrow →
`set_param_typed`, identical to the qwen35 case) and `generator.rs` (which
`to_vec()`s from the borrow, so it paid the fault-in *and* the copy — now one
copy). Verified output-identical on Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M; the saving there is only
50 MB because the checkpoint is 400 MB, but it scales with checkpoint size, as
the 4.7 / 19.6 GB qwen35 numbers below show. Revert with
`RLX_QWEN3_MMAP_UPLOAD=1`.

`rlx-dflash`, `rlx-gemma` and `rlx-lfm` have the same pattern and are **not**
fixed — no local weights for them, and an unverifiable change to a hot load
path is not worth making blind. The fix is mechanical: `pread` into one reused
scratch via `read_tensor_bytes_into`, falling back to the borrow when the
loader has no streaming backing. `rlx-models-core/standard_decoder.rs` borrows
only to read `.len()`, which faults nothing, so it needs no change.

**Peak RSS: ✅ a second win, and it is not Bonsai-specific.** `rlx-qwen35`
uploaded packed weights by *borrowing* from the mmap. The arena copy reads
through that borrow, so it faults in every page of the checkpoint and leaves a
second full-size copy resident — and on macOS that is unreclaimable short of
`munmap` (`release_mapped_pages`, which rlx-llama32 calls, is a no-op there).
Switched to `pread` into one reused scratch, so resident cost is the largest
single tensor rather than the whole file:

| | RSS mmap | RSS stream | saved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Ternary Bonsai 2 (5.5 GB weights) | 28.6 GB | **23.9 GB** | 4.7 GB |
| Qwen3.8-27B-Q3_K_S (13 GB weights) | 41.7 GB | **22.1 GB** | **19.6 GB** |

Reproducible to 0.1 GB. Costs ~400 ms of one-time upload and ~0.5 GB of
footprint (the scratch). Every qwen35 model benefits, not just this one.
Revert with `RLX_QWEN35_MMAP_UPLOAD=1`.

**Peak memory: ✅ a third win — leave `token_embd` packed.** The table is
`[248320, 5120]`: 278 MB packed, **4.74 GiB as F32**, and decode reads exactly
one row per token. It is now gathered on demand from the packed bytes, with
the `prism.hadamard` inverse applied per row instead of to all 248320 at load.
**RSS/footprint 24.0 → 18.9 GB**, and weight load drops from 4.69 s to 11 ms
because the 4.7 GiB dequant never happens (TTFT unchanged — that time moves
into compile).

Gated on the packed table being readable (`token_embd_lm`) and the host-gather
path being on, so neither the lookup nor the LM head needs the F32 copy. That
covers **tied** heads too: both the host head (`lm_head.rs`) and the graph head
(`builder.rs`) reach for `token_embd_lm` first and only fall back to the F32
table when it is absent, which the gate rules out. Opt out with
`RLX_QWEN35_NO_LAZY_EMBED=1`.

It therefore helps every packed qwen35 model, not just this one:

| model | weights | RSS dense | RSS lazy | saved |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Ternary Bonsai 2 (untied) | 5.5 GB | 24.05 GB | **18.78 GB** | 5.3 GB |
| Bonsai 1 Q1_0 (tied) | 3.8 GB | 16.51 GB | **11.61 GB** | 4.9 GB |
| Qwen3.8-27B-Q3_K_S (tied) | 13 GB | 32.24 GB | **20.19 GB** | **12.1 GB** |

Qwen3.8 saves more than the 4.74 GiB table itself, and its GPU-side footprint
is unchanged (50.6 GB either way) — the F32 table was costing host RSS in more
than one place.

The field is now `pub(crate)` behind `Qwen35Weights::token_embd()`, which
**panics** under a lazy table rather than returning the empty slice. That
matters more than the encapsulation: every caller indexes the table directly,
so an empty one reads as zeros — a model that loads, runs, and emits plausible
tokens from nothing. Privatising it turned ~45 call sites across five crates
into compile errors the compiler enumerated, and each was then a deliberate
choice: metadata queries to `embd_elems()`, real gathers to `embed_row_into`,
and the paths the gate excludes (tied head, resident embed) left to panic on
purpose.

**Running total on Ternary Bonsai 2: 32.2 → 18.9 GB footprint (−41%), ~36 →
18.9 GB RSS (−47%).**

**Next, and fully diagnosed but NOT fixed: prefill and decode each hold a
private copy of the packed weights — 5.6 GB on the 27B.** Evidence: peak
footprint is 18.6 GB at `max_seq=13`, where a specialised decode bucket is
compiled and warmed alongside the prefill graph, and 13.0 GB at
`max_seq=512`, where no separate decode graph is built (decode then runs
through the prefill graph, at 1.83 tok/s instead of 8.97 — slower, but with
one copy of the weights). The 5.6 GB delta is exactly the packed weight size.

The machinery looks like it should fix it — `CompiledGraph::share_params_from`
→ `MetalExecutable::share_weights_from` retains one refcounted MTLBuffer for
both, and decode buckets already use it via `try_share_params_from_donor`. It
does not, and the reason is further down than it appears. Traced end to end by
instrumenting every refusal path in turn:

1. `DeferredExecutable` (what `BuiltModel` produces) does not override
   `share_params_from` / `executable_as_any`, so the trait defaults refuse
   before any Metal code runs. **Fixed by delegating to the live
   specialization.**
2. `share_weights_from` requires `param_ids.len()` equality — 1065 for prefill
   against 1015 for decode. Stricter than the invariant needs: its own loop
   already tolerates arena-only params, so only the weight *slots* must agree.
   **Fixed by dropping the count check.**
3. Weight-buffer offsets follow node-iteration order, so two graphs over the
   same tensors disagree anyway. **Fixed by ordering the layout by param name.**
4. And then it still refuses, because **`metal_encoder_binds_weight_buffer`
   matches only `GgufQ1_0`** — PTQ1_0 weights are never externalized into the
   shareable buffer at all; they live inline in each graph's arena, so there is
   no weight slot to share and `share_weights_from` is structurally
   inapplicable. Adding `GgufPtq1_0` to that predicate (the fused GEMV already
   reads through `resolve_off`, exactly as Q1_0's does) still did not flip it,
   so there is at least a fifth condition.

All four were implemented, verified individually as necessary-but-not-
sufficient, and **reverted** — unproven enabling changes that loosen a safety
check and relocate every Metal model's weight layout are not worth carrying for
a win that never landed. Worth ~30% of peak memory to someone who picks it up;
start at (4), since (1)–(3) are known-good and quick to redo.

Note the two metrics measure different things and both matter: `peak memory
footprint` tracks the GPU/anonymous allocations (what the arena-scratch fix
moved) and is stable to a tenth of a GB; `maximum resident set size` includes
file-backed pages (what the upload fix moved) and swings several GB run to run
unless you control for the page cache.

One graph simplification landed alongside: `repeat_heads` built the GDN's GQA
expansion as `in_heads * factor` single-head narrows concatenated, when the
tiling it produces is just `[x, x, x]` — the inner run of slices reconstructs
`x` exactly. Now `factor` pieces instead of 48, which removes ~4600 narrow
nodes from graph construction and 96 dispatches per token. Provably identical
and it is simply better code; wall-clock effect was within noise.

**Measured negatives, so they are not retried.** Rows-per-simdgroup 8 → 16 on
the integer kernel (slower; `x` is already cached). Factoring the rotation as
`H_1024 = H_32 ⊗ H_32` — exactly equal, 4 KB instead of 4 MB — slower, because
the matrix stays cached and doubling the dispatch count costs more than the
traffic saved. `RLX_QWEN35_GPU_KV=1` (in-place KV append): no measurable gain.

## Standing action items (where rlx does NOT yet meet all 3)

1. **RAM — big global win landed (CPU pin fix).** Root cause of the bloat was
   `MemoryPlanOptions::inference()` defaulting `pin_output_ancestors: true`,
   which pins the whole output-ancestor DAG to the last step and **destroys
   liveness slot reuse** on deep feed-forward graphs. The CPU backend is an
   **in-order executor** so it never needed that guard: switched both
   `cpu_backend.rs` plan sites `plan_memory_aligned` → `plan_memory_native`
   (same Native dtype widths; pins only on host indexing). Result on supertonic:
   vector_estimator arena 1.36 GB→327 MB, vocoder 1.17 GB→177 MB, **max RSS
   2.94 GB→1.0 GB**, wall 8.15 s→2.9 s, **output byte-identical** (parity
   untouched). This helps EVERY deep feed-forward CPU graph (vocoders,
   estimators). Remaining supertonic gap to ort (0.52 GB) is now ~1.9× (was
   5.7×) — closable with a shared arena across the sequential ve/voc graphs +
   optional f16 activations (would break byte-identical, so gated).
2. **Speed/RAM benching — harness landed (2026-09), sweep still to run.** The TTS
   bench already recorded RTF; it had no memory column at all. Added
   `rlx_tts_bench::metrics::{peak_rss_mb, RssTracker, RssMetrics}`, mirroring
   `rlx_llm_bench::metrics::peak_rss_mb` / `rlx_core::asr_bench::peak_rss_mb` so all three
   leaderboards compute the column the same way. Two details make it meaningful rather than
   decorative: the suite already runs every `(model, device)` cell in its own **worker
   subprocess**, so `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF)` is scoped to one model; and `ru_maxrss` is a
   monotonic high-water mark, so the tracker snapshots a **baseline before the adapter is
   constructed** and reports `peak - baseline` — otherwise the Whisper scorer (loaded before
   the model loop) is charged to every small TTS model. `results.jsonl` carries all three
   numbers, `BACKENDS.md` gains a "Peak RAM (MB, model only)" table, and `summary.json` gains
   `max_model_rss_mb` (max, not median — the criterion is "same-or-less RAM than the
   reference"). First measured row: **luxtts cpu = 13 380 MB at RTF 0.55**. Populating the
   rest of the ledger is now just a full sweep.
3. **maya1 / chatterbox CPU speed.** 3B / 24k-node graphs are impractically
   slow on CPU; Metal is the usable path. **chatterbox is not merely "big" — its T3 LM runs
   an O(N²) re-prefill** (a full prompt+generated forward for *every* token). A true KV-cache
   decode exists but is opt-in (`RLX_CB_NATIVE_LM_KV=1`) because it is **broken**: its own gate,
   `examples/native_t3_kv_parity`, fails at cosine **−0.127** (`decode(1 tok | past)` vs
   `prefill(T+1)[row T]`).
   Narrowed (2026-09), not yet fixed — the gate now takes `RLX_T3_KV_T` / `RLX_T3_KV_UPPER` /
   `RLX_T3_KV_POS` and prints a past-sensitivity and input-acceptance probe:
   - not the bucket padding — identical cosine at `upper` = 6, 7, 12;
   - the past *is* reaching attention — zeroing it moves the logits (cosine 0.51, not identical);
   - it fails even at `t = 1`, where the only past position is 0 and RoPE is the identity, so a
     pre/post-RoPE export mix-up is excluded;
   - **the `position` input is accepted by the compiled graph but has zero effect on the output**
     — cosine identical to 8 decimals for position 0, 6 and 12. So the new token's RoPE row is
     not coming from `position`, and present/past keys sit in different position frames.
   `GatherDecodeRopeStage` looks correct in isolation (gathers row `position` from the tables and
   overwrites `state.rope_cos/sin`, which `self_attn` reads by default — no named slot is set),
   so the next step is a dump of the lowered decode graph to see what actually feeds the RoPE.
   Note while there: that gather indexes with the **F32** `position` input and `Op::Gather` wants
   an integer — worth casting when this is wired up (casting alone changed nothing here, so it is
   not the failing link).
   Fixing this turns chatterbox CPU from O(N²) into O(N) and is the real answer to the timeout.
4. **chatterbox Metal "low cosine" is NOT a bug — inherent AR near-tie flip.**
   The TTS-bench reported chatterbox `cosine_vs_cpu` ≈ 0.03–0.05 on Metal while
   MLX was 1.0. Root-caused (per-token dump + per-step logit diag on the exact
   bench input): Metal's native T3 LM (rlx-llama32) is **bit-exact vs CPU for the
   first 110 of 141 greedy tokens**, then flips ONE token at step 110. Mechanism:
   the token is a repeat, so `sample()`'s repetition penalty (÷1.2) pulls its
   raw logit (gap 2.47 over runner-up) down to an **exact tie** with the runner-up;
   at that tie a **~1e-4 relative** MPSGraph-vs-CPU f32 matmul/reduction difference
   (4137 logit 14.8123 Metal vs 14.8133 CPU) decides the argmax the other way.
   MLX's reduction order happened to match CPU at this step (luck, not
   correctness). One flip cascades the tail's phase → waveform cosine collapses,
   but the speech is **correct**: whisper 6/6, coverage 1.0, logmel 0.97.
   → Two takeaways: (a) **waveform cosine is the wrong parity metric for AR/LM
   TTS** — use greedy token-prefix agreement + whisper coverage + logmel; (b) the
   bench now decodes **deterministically** (`SynthRequest.deterministic=true` →
   chatterbox `greedy`) so the comparison measures the compute path, not RNG.
   Debug knobs added (env-gated, off by default): `RLX_CB_DUMP_TOKENS`,
   `RLX_CB_LOGIT_DIAG`.

## Cross-backend matrix (remote sweeps via `scripts/matrix/run_matrix.py`)

Whisper coverage is built into the matrix (every TTS run is transcribed). Backends
per host = host-detected ∩ crate cargo features.

**amd** (Instinct MI100) — devices cpu/wgpu/rocm. Pass on **all three** backends:
qwen3-0.6b, whisper, melotts, tiny-tts, chatterbox, sesame; supertonic passes cpu.
Findings surfaced:
- **rocm** `Reduce: only single last-axis supported (axes=[1,2])` → **FIXED**:
  generalized `rlx-rocm/backend/compile.rs` Reduce to any contiguous trailing-axis
  suffix (inner=∏trailing, outer=∏leading). Verified on amd: panic cleared,
  supertonic/rocm now runs the full graph (125 s).
- **supertonic GPU divergence = Linux-wgpu + rocm ONLY (open).** On **mac** ALL
  backends PASS (metal/mlx/**wgpu**/coreml all cos 1.000). On msi native
  **vulkan PASSES** (1.000) and **cuda PASSES** (0.976); only Linux **wgpu**
  (−0.000) and **rocm** (−0.016) fail. So it is NOT a supertonic-graph bug and NOT
  wgpu-the-abstraction (mac-wgpu=Metal passes) — it's specific to the Linux
  wgpu (Vulkan-backed) + rocm lowering. Deep, remote-only; low priority since
  cpu/metal/mlx/coreml/vulkan/cuda all pass.
- **kokoro Apple-GPU regression (open, local).** Was "cos 1.0 all 5 backends";
  now on mac: cpu ✅, **wgpu ✅ 0.984**, but **metal ❌ −0.051, mlx 💥 panic**
  (`Reshape [1,512,384] ⟵ Gather [192,384]` — element-count mismatch 73728≠196608,
  a shape-inference/lowering bug), **coreml ❌** (`mps.reshape` shape incompatible).
  All three Apple-GPU failures are reshape-related. **Root cause (analyzed):** the
  mlx Reshape lowering already uses the *runtime* input shape (`env.rs:459`
  `x.shape()`), so the panic means the Gather genuinely produced `[192,384]` at
  runtime on mlx while the reshape needs `[512,384]` — a **data-dependent
  dynamic-shape divergence** in kokoro's decoder (gather length = Σdurations /
  length-regulator differs on mlx vs cpu), NOT a general reshape bug. Deep +
  kokoro-specific (needs the duration/alignment path to match cpu on Apple GPU).
  cpu + wgpu tolerate it (runtime buffer sizing). Needs a focused session, not a
  cron slice.
  **UPDATE (2026-08): MLX decoder REGRESSED then FIXED (real op fix).** Bench
  caught styletts2/mlx = garbage (cos 0.014, whisper 0/6). Localized via a
  CPU-vs-MLX per-node dump aligned on Conv/MatMul anchors → first divergence was
  the ISTFTNet **depthwise `ConvTranspose2d` (groups=512)**: MLX's native grouped
  transpose-conv **mixes channels across groups** → output ~25× too large (76.7 vs
  CPU 3.0). **Fix (rlx-mlx):** host-eval `ConvTranspose2d` for `groups>1` in
  `lower/env.rs` + `lower/mod.rs`, mirroring the existing `ConvTranspose3d
  groups>1 → host` fallback. Result: **styletts2/mlx cos 0.9925, fox 6/6, rtf
  1.95× (fastest backend)**; 25 rlx-mlx parity tests still pass. The temporary
  decoder-on-CPU stopgap was removed. See [[kokoro_multibackend_parity]].
- **TTS-bench "broken model" sweep (2026-08).** Full 23-model deterministic run
  surfaced these; fixes this session: **styletts2/mlx** garbage → real rlx-mlx
  grouped-ConvTranspose2d fix (above), cos 0.9925 fox 6/6, rtf 1.95× ✅. **voxtral-tts** FAIL "no .f32 embedding" → ran
  `--convert-voices` (20 `.pt`→`.f32`) ✅ data-fixed (4B then OOM/crashes on load
  — separate). **qwen3-tts** FAIL "missing tokenizer.json" → built it from
  `vocab.json`+`merges.txt` via `AutoTokenizer.save_pretrained` (Base repo doesn't
  ship one) → cpu **fox 6/6** rtf 0.253 ✅. **kyutai** FAIL "missing voice
  embedding" → `hf download kyutai/tts-voices alba-mackenna/casual.wav…safetensors`
  → backbone loads/runs (data-unblocked) but output **fox 0/6**.
  **FIXED (2026-09) — fox 0/6 → 6/6 on CPU and Metal.** The output is not unintelligible at all — Whisper transcribes fluent English that
  simply ignores the script ("I can't do this." on repeat). With `RLX_KYUTAI_TTS_EAGER=1` the
  same prompt returns **"Hello World!"**. `KyutaiTtsBackend::open` defaults to the RLX path
  (`use_rlx = !force_eager || force_native`), so the shipped path is the broken one.
  Evidence: the eager text head is dominated by `pad`(3) and `new_word`(0) with every word
  token masked to ≈ −17, exactly as a DSM text stream should be; the RLX head returns 8000
  logits that are **all equal to ~1e-7** with pad/new_word at ~0. The divergence is upstream of
  the head — a single decode step from a reset state gives backbone `hidden` **cosine −0.617**
  (max|Δ| 3.55) between the two stacks.
  **Why it shipped: the parity suite is vacuous.** `rlx_backend_parity.rs` calls
  `assert_logits_match_cpu(label, &cpu, &cpu)` for CPU and otherwise compares the RLX graph on
  one device against the *same graph* on another — cross-device self-consistency, which passes
  just as happily when the graph is uniformly wrong. New test
  `tests/rlx_vs_eager_backbone.rs` makes the real comparison (skips without the checkpoint,
  fails loudly with it) and is the bisect harness for the fix.
  Second, independent defect found in the same read: eager **skips** cross-attention when
  there is no speaker and uses only the real context frames when there is one, while the RLX
  graph always attends over a zero-padded `MAX_SPEAKER_CROSS_FRAMES` buffer with
  `MaskKind::None`, so padding frames join the softmax. Needs a cross-attention mask input.
  A `RLX_KYUTAI_TTS_TRACE` logits dump was added to the RLX path mirroring the eager one, so
  the two heads can be diffed step-for-step.
  **Root cause: the SwiGLU width was derived from the config instead of the checkpoint.**
  `hidden_scale` is not the hidden width — Kyutai applies the usual SwiGLU ⅔ adjustment, so the
  1.6B checkpoint stores `gating.linear_in.weight = [11264, 2048]` (hidden **5632**) while
  `TtsDims::from_cfg` computed `dim_feedforward / 2 = (2048·4.125)/2 = **4224**`. Every
  gate/up/down slice in the RLX graph was taken at the wrong offset and `linear_out` was
  transposed against the wrong stride, so all 16 layers were garbage. The eager path was
  unaffected because it reads the tensor's own shape. Fix: `TtsDims::from_cfg_and_weights`
  takes `ffn` from `gating.linear_in.weight`, and `for_each_transformer_param` now *ensures*
  the slice matches the stored element count instead of mis-slicing silently.
  Cross-attention is masked too, so the zero padding no longer joins the softmax (synthetic
  gate: max|Δ| 5.5e-3 → 1.2e-7).
  **The fixture hid it**: `synthetic_weights` built `[2·(dim·hidden_scale/2), dim]` — the same
  wrong convention as the buggy `from_cfg` — so the two agreed and no test could disagree. It
  now emits checkpoint-shaped `[2·⅔·dim_feedforward, dim]`, and `tests/rlx_vs_eager_layer.rs`
  compares the RLX graph against the eager `StreamingTransformer` on synthetic weights (no
  checkpoint needed, so it runs in CI) at 1/2/3 layers, plus a case pinning the convention and
  asserting the binder now fails loudly on a config-derived width.
  Verified: whole kyutai suite green (incl. 8 cross-backend cells), real-weight backbone parity
  passes, and e2e Whisper returns the prompt verbatim on **cpu and metal**. **gepard metal/mlx crash FIXED** —
  the qwen35 `clear_host_dense_projections` (runner.rs) now skips the release when
  `weights_path` is empty (inline_weights has no on-disk source to reload from),
  so Metal/MLX decode no longer panics with "F32 projections released, no weights
  path". Metal runs (11.9 s). Helps any inline_weights qwen35 backbone on Apple
  GPU. **gepard fox 0/6 → 6/6 FIXED (2026-08):** not a port bug — the bench ran
  gepard's default temperature sampling (0.4) which **free-runs into coherent but
  WRONG words** ("The love is a cure…"); **greedy is faithful** (whisper "The quick
  brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."). Adapter now honors `deterministic`→greedy →
  gepard cpu **6/6**, metal **6/6**. Same class as chatterbox. **kittentts — FIXED (three
  independent defects, 2026-09).** The reported symptom was an MLX Reshape panic, runtime
  `[1,200100,9]` vs static `[1,200000,9]`; underneath it were three separate bugs.
  (1) **Waveform caps were not frame-aligned.** The vocoder divides `max_wave` two ways —
  the NSF sine chain at `MEL_DIV`=300 (the `f0_upsamp` nearest ×300) and the generator AdaIN
  at `SAMPLES_PER_ALIGNMENT_FRAME`=600 — both with `div_ceil`. A cap that is not a whole
  number of *both* makes the upsampled sine source longer than the axis it feeds:
  `ceil(200_000/300)*300 = 200_100`. The bench adapter passes a round `200_000`; the wgpu
  (32 k) and Vulkan (80 k) storage-bind ceilings are equally unaligned, all off by exactly
  100 samples. Fix: `bundle_patches::align_waveform_cap` rounds **down** to a 600 boundary
  (down, not up — those caps are memory ceilings), applied at `compile_waveform_cap`,
  `device_policy::clamp_waveform`, and `set_import_max_waveform_samples`. Test
  `kitten_tts_mini_rlx/tests/waveform_cap_alignment.rs`.
  (2) **`f0_upsamp` was importing as ZEROS** — upstream `rlx-onnx-import` lowered nearest
  `Resize` only for 2×2 and *width*-only shapes, so KittenTTS's `[1,1,1,F]→[1,1,300,F]`
  **height** upsample fell through to the zero stub. The NSF f0 source was dead on every
  backend. Fixed in `../rlx` with the rank-4 case of the NCDHW split-and-broadcast identity
  (`[N,C,H,1,W,1]` expanded to `[N,C,H,kh,W,kw]`); test
  `rlx-onnx-import/tests/resize_nearest_height.rs`.
  (3) **The f0 repair patched the wrong node.** The importer lowers one ONNX op into a chain
  and stamps the ONNX name on several links; `find_node_by_name` returns the *first*, but
  consumers read the *last*. `inject_f0_nearest_upsample` rewrote the head, leaving the
  voicing-mask `Greater` on a stale rank-4 `[1,1,300,seq]` alias while patching its output to
  `[1,max_wave,1]` — a rank-reducing "broadcast" no backend can run. Now uses
  `find_last_node_by_name`.
  Result: `kitten_tts_mini_rlx` lib **19/19** (was 15/19 — the 4 failures were (2)),
  `native_smoke` **2/2** (was 0/2, hard panic), `native_weights_parity` green, and the bench
  configuration `(256, 200_000)` now synthesizes on **CPU and MLX** (`bench_cap_regression.rs`).
  Whisper on the long fixture: *"This is a longer sentence for testing the K-10 text to speech
  system in."* Remaining (pre-existing, minor): `native_hello_via_whisper` transcribes the
  0.35 s `həˈloʊ` as "holo"; the native-vs-reference parity test passes, so this is the model's
  own rendering, not a graph bug. Also fixed: `native_smoke.rs` lacked the process-global
  compile-cap mutex `native_whisper_roundtrip.rs` has, so its two tests raced (the long one
  picked up the short one's 48 k cap and returned 2 s of audio).
  **parlertts/GPU** cos 0.22 but fox 6/6 — NOT an rlx
  bug: benign temperature-sampling divergence (adapter ran `greedy:false`). Its
  *greedy* path had a **model prompt-length bug (FIXED)**: `native.rs` assumed the
  decoder's prompt prefix == `pt` (prompt_ids.len()), but the exported decoder
  emits a **fixed-length prefix (empirically 19, independent of `pt`)** → `seq !=
  pt+t` assertion fired for any transcript whose token count ≠ 19 (only the bench
  phrase's pt=19 coincidentally passed). Fix: derive prefix from the returned
  `seq` (`seq_idx = (seq - t) + step`) instead of `pt`. Greedy now works for any
  text on **all backends** (verified: whisper "the quick…" on MLX). The MLX panic
  was NOT a shape-inference bug — it was a **stale AOT cache-key collision**: the
  persistent `$TMPDIR/rlx_parler_native` cache keyed decoder graphs by `seq` only
  (=t=420), not `pt`/`et`, so a graph compiled for one transcript length served
  another → baked `prompt_input_ids [1,19]` for a pt=13 transcript → MLX
  `from_bytes` panic (CPU tolerated it). Fix: fold all named dims into the cache
  key (`native.rs`). Bench adapter re-wired to `greedy: req.deterministic`.
  **Lesson: an MLX static-shape panic whose HIR shape is correct = suspect a stale
  cache entry, not shape inference.**
- **moss-nano + luxtts build fix (FIXED + VALIDATED).** Both `FAIL in 0s` on every
  host was a **stale registry** `features_base = ["onnx"]` — both crates removed
  their ort `onnx` feature (native-only now), so cargo errored "feature does not
  exist". Set `features_base = []` in `scripts/matrix/registry.toml`. **Validated
  on mac: moss-nano now PASSES all 5 backends** — cpu, metal 1.000, mlx 1.000,
  wgpu 1.000, coreml 1.000 (was 100% build-blocked). **luxtts — now 5/5 on mac
  (FIXED 2026-09):** cpu, metal, mlx, wgpu, coreml all **cos 0.99848**. The wgpu
  panic had moved on from "remainder with divisor of zero" to `rlx-wgpu arena: no
  offset for node NodeId(731)`, and behind it were two upstream bugs, both about
  **zero-element tensors** (LuxTTS's flow decoder builds an `Expand [0,1,512]`):
  (a) `rlx_compile::memory` only records a buffer when its slot size is non-zero, so
  a zero-element tensor gets no assignment and every `Arena::offset` lookup panicked.
  `compile_static_inner` now gives each one an explicit empty slot, and
  `arena_span_bytes` skips zero-length ids so they never anchor a bind window.
  (b) With the node compiling, the run loop then **hung forever**: ~79 match arms in
  `WgpuExecutable::run_inner` guard a degenerate dispatch with `if <extent> == 0 {
  continue; }`, but the only `step_i += 1` for a dispatched step is at the bottom of
  that loop — so every one of them re-entered on the same step indefinitely. (They
  must also consume the step's bind group, or every later step binds the wrong one;
  the `static_once` skip a few lines above already does exactly this.) Any model with
  a zero-extent step was affected, not just luxtts. Tests:
  `rlx-wgpu/tests/empty_tensor_arena_slot.rs`; full rlx-wgpu suite green.
  Remotes pick up the corrected registry on their next matrix run.
- **build** moss-nano + luxtts `[gpu,onnx]` fail on Linux (ort feature) — expected;
  these still need the native path on non-mac.
- **data-prep** kokoro + styletts2 need `scripts/split_kokoro.py` run on the remote
  (bundle missing `encoder.onnx`) — cheap unblock, 6 cells.

**msi** (RTX 3080 Ti) — devices cpu/wgpu/cuda/vulkan. qwen3-0.6b: cpu PASS,
**cuda PASS (4.6 s)**, vulkan PASS, wgpu WARN (known qwen3 wgpu decode 1/8).
Per-model TTS (cpu / wgpu / cuda / vulkan):
| model | cpu | wgpu | cuda (post clone-fix) | vulkan |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| kokoro | ✅ | ❌ −0.035 | 🔶 0.263 (was silent) | ✅ 0.975 |
| supertonic | ✅ | ❌ −0.000 | ✅ 0.976 | ✅ 1.000 |
| piper | ✅ | ⚠️ 0.889 | ✅ **1.000** (was silent) | ✅ 1.000 |

The **clone_for_cache param fix** un-silenced all cuda entries above; piper is now
bit-exact. kokoro/styletts2/zipvoice retain a separate cuda decoder parity-drift
(kokoro/styletts2 0.263 shared StyleTTS2 decoder, zipvoice 0.469): localized to
the sine source — some standalone `Activation(Sin)` outputs read identity though
`unary.cu case 13u=sinf` and the launch (op=13, args) are all verified correct →
suspect an arena slot-offset mismatch (Step writes sinf to a slot the node's
consumers don't read). Deep, open. Two correct kernel-completeness fixes also
landed: `fused_binary_unary.cu` + `batch/elementwise_region.cu` now handle
activation opcodes 12–28 (were identity past 11) — benefits any model fusing
Mul→Sin etc., though kokoro uses standalone unary so it doesn't move kokoro.
Build gotcha: those `.cu` are `include_str!`'d — force recompile with
`rm -rf target/release/build/rlx-gpu-kernels-* .fingerprint/rlx-gpu-kernels-*`.

**Shared-bug clusters (high value — one fix helps many):**
- **cuda `silent (peak=0.00)`** for kokoro + piper + zipvoice + styletts2 —
  **FIXED.** Root cause: rlx-cuda `clone_for_cache()` recompiled into a fresh
  zeroed arena but never copied the `set_param`-uploaded `Op::Param` weights, so
  `TinyModel::compile_named().clone()` consumers (piper flow_dec etc.) ran with
  **zero weights**. Fix = `copy_params_from(self)` D2D-copies every param slot in
  `backend/mod.rs`. **piper cuda: silent → 39936 samples.** (run_named models like
  supertonic were unaffected — no clone.) Was a regression (CUDA-green 2026-07-18).
  Below is the pre-fix state, kept for reference:
  **Investigated on msi (piper, pure VITS):** the 3 HiFiGAN upsampling
  ConvTranspose2d ops dispatch to cuDNN fine (correct shapes 250→2000→16000→64000),
  and forcing the kernel path (`RLX_CUDA_CONV_T_KERNEL=1`) is ALSO silent → **NOT
  the ConvTranspose**. Confirmed: **melotts + tiny-tts (same VITS/HiFiGAN
  ConvTranspose1d) PASS on cuda**, so H=1 transposed-conv works on CUDA. piper
  cuda runs suspiciously fast (881 ms) then silent → zeros likely originate
  upstream (an op CUDA mis-handles for these 4 graphs, possibly returning a
  zero buffer). **Narrowed by elimination — an op INSIDE flow_dec computes zero
  on CUDA.** RULED OUT: ConvTranspose (cuDNN + `RLX_CUDA_CONV_T_KERNEL=1` +
  `RLX_CUDA_NO_CUDNN=1` all silent; melotts uses same op, passes); input-binding
  (added `RLX_CUDA_INPUT_DIAG` → both flow_dec inputs confirmed uploaded:
  `/Add_output_0`=14400 f32, `/Cast_2_output_0`=75); arena reuse
  (`RLX_ARENA_NO_REUSE=1` no help); the cpu `plan_memory_native` change (piper
  **cpu still works**, 19200 samples). Post-run `DUMP_INTERMEDIATE` is unreliable
  (reuse overwrites → all read 0). **Fix** = compute-time per-op cuda-vs-cpu diff
  to find the first op with nonzero inputs → zero output (VITS flow / coupling /
  WN convs; melotts VITS2 is fine). Focused session. See memory
  `cuda_silent_split_graph_input`.
- **wgpu TTS cosine divergence** kokoro −0.035, supertonic −0.000, styletts2
  −0.021 — possibly one shared wgpu bug (or a regression: kokoro was cos 1.0 on
  all 5 backends per `kokoro_multibackend_parity`). wgpu is **local-reproducible
  on mac** → bisect there. supertonic wgpu+rocm both fail but cuda+vulkan pass.
- **vulkan is the strongest GPU backend** — all TTS pass (0.975–1.000).
- moss-nano/luxtts `FAIL in 0s` = onnx feature won't build on Linux (need native).

## Method

- Parity: native-vs-ort per-subgraph + e2e cosine + whisper transcript
  (`scripts/spectral_temporal.py`, `RLX_ONNX_TAP` + `RLX_NO_OPT=1`).
- Speed/RAM: wall-time + peak RSS on a fixed reference clip, native vs the ort
  baseline recorded when the crate still had a reference path.
- Cross-backend: `run_matrix.py` on each host; `remote_run.sh` / nohup for msi+amd.
