//! Shared pieces for building a **pre-training objective** onto a model trunk.
//!
//! Most ports in this workspace carry a `train.rs` that fits a supervised head
//! over frozen features and a note saying the model's real pre-training objective
//! is "out of scope". Implementing those objectives needs the same three things
//! every time — select the masked positions, build a loss into the graph, and work
//! out which parameters may be differentiated — so they live here rather than
//! being copied per crate.
//!
//! # Two things that are not obvious and cost a debugging session each
//!
//! **Not every `Op::Param` is trainable.** `ModelFlow::attn_mask_ones` declares the
//! all-ones attention mask as a *parameter*. It is reachable from the loss (through
//! `Op::Attention`) yet categorically non-differentiable, and
//! `rlx_autodiff::grad_with_loss` **panics** on a request for it — "no gradient
//! flowed to %N" — rather than returning zero. [`trainable_params`] filters it out.
//!
//! **Masked positions must be distinguishable from one another.** If every masked
//! slot receives the same mask token and the trunk carries no positional signal,
//! those slots are identical inputs to a permutation-equivariant attention stack,
//! so the best possible reconstruction is the per-feature *mean* of the targets.
//! That is a hard floor no learning rate moves: measured on `rlx-brant`, the loss
//! sat at exactly `0.037616` for a 3-position mask — the mean-predictor MSE to six
//! decimals — identically at `1e-3` and `1e-2`. [`add_sinusoidal_positions`] is the
//! cheap fix when the trunk does not add positions itself.
//!
//! **A masked objective needs a real batch.** This is the one that cost the most.
//! Reconstructing a masked slot means routing another position's content through
//! attention, and that is a structural solution the optimizer has to find; a
//! per-token one is always available and much easier. With one window per step the
//! gradient noise hides the first and leaves the second, and the run *underfits* —
//! on real EEG (1600 Bonn windows, `seq=64`, 16-sample patches, `dim=64`) the train
//! loss stalled at 0.98 against a mean-predictor 1.007, i.e. 2% of the variance,
//! while the identical graph autoencoded a **visible** patch to 0.0018 (99.8%).
//! Stacking 8 windows per step and changing nothing else took it to 17% within 15
//! epochs and still falling. Before blaming the objective, the trunk or the port:
//!
//! * Run the **unmasked control** — score the same positions without blanking them.
//!   If that does not approach zero the problem is the path, not the routing, and no
//!   amount of masked-objective tuning will find it.
//! * Compare against a **least-squares map from the neighbouring positions** fit on
//!   the same split. Z-scored data puts the mean predictor at ~1.0, so any loss just
//!   under 1.0 reads as progress; the linear number says how much is there to get.
//!   On the Bonn split it is 0.590 — 41% of the variance — so 2% was not "EEG is
//!   unpredictable", it was a bug-shaped result.
