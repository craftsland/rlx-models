# rlx-models-core

Shared config, weight loading, compile profiles, and packed GGUF prefill helpers for RLX model crates (published on crates.io as **`rlx-models-core`**; import as `rlx_core`).

**Workspace 0.2.14** (crates.io `rlx-models-core`; depends on upstream `rlx*` 0.2.14). Packed GGUF support (since 0.2.1):

| API | Role |
|-----|------|
| [`packed_gguf_compile_guard`](src/flow_bridge.rs) | Metal `RLX_DISABLE_MPSGRAPH`, MLX `RLX_MLX_MODE=lazy` during compile |
| [`compile_options_for_packed_gguf_prefill_with_profile`](src/flow_bridge.rs) | Fusion off on wgpu/CUDA/ROCm for `FusedResidualRmsNorm` gaps |
| [`packed_gguf_execution_device`](src/flow_bridge.rs) | Native CPU/Metal/MLX/CUDA/wgpu/Vulkan/CoreML packed; `*_HOST=1` forces CPU |
| [`run_packed_prefill`](src/autoregressive.rs) | Active-extent packed prefill execute (`actual_seq` inside bucket) |
| [`EmbeddedSafetensors`](src/embedded_safetensors.rs) | Parse HF safetensors from `include_bytes!` / memory; `tensor_f32(name)` |
| [`tensor_view_to_f32`](src/safetensors_checkpoint.rs) | Decode F32/F16/BF16 safetensor views to `Vec<f32>` |
| [`weights_discover`](src/weights_discover.rs) | Scan LM Studio / Ollama / HF / Lemonade / RLX local caches; resolve short names |

Used by `rlx-llama32`, `rlx-qwen3`, `rlx-gemma`, `rlx-minicpm5`, and `rlx-vad` (embedded Silero weights).

### Embedded safetensors

For small models shipped inside the binary:

```rust
use rlx_core::embedded_safetensors::EmbeddedSafetensors;

const WEIGHTS: &[u8] = include_bytes!("../weights/model.safetensors");

let st = EmbeddedSafetensors::parse(WEIGHTS)?;
let w = st.tensor_f32("layer.weight")?;
```

Disk-backed sharded checkpoints still use [`SafetensorsCheckpoint`](src/safetensors_checkpoint.rs) (mmap + index.json).

### Local weights discovery

Walk on-disk caches used by common LLM apps (no network) and either list hits or resolve a short query to one path. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (`%USERPROFILE%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `%TEMP%`; `RLX_WEIGHTS_PATHS` uses `;` on Windows).

| API | Role |
|-----|------|
| [`scan_weights`](src/weights_discover.rs) | Scan default host roots |
| [`scan_weights_in_roots`](src/weights_discover.rs) | Scan caller-supplied roots only (tests / embedded) |
| [`resolve_weight_query`](src/weights_discover.rs) | Pick one path for a substring query |
| [`resolve_weight_query_in_roots`](src/weights_discover.rs) | Same, restricted roots |
| [`resolve_weights_path_or_query`](src/weights_discover.rs) | Existing path → file resolve; else short-name discovery |
| [`default_source_roots`](src/weights_discover.rs) | Existing default roots only |
| [`looks_like_filesystem_path`](src/weights_discover.rs) | Distinguishes `C:\…` / `./…` from `qwen3-0.6b` |

```rust
use rlx_core::{DiscoverOpts, WeightSourceKind, resolve_weight_query, scan_weights};

let hits = scan_weights(
    &DiscoverOpts::default()
        .with_query("qwen")
        .with_sources(vec![WeightSourceKind::LmStudio, WeightSourceKind::HuggingFace]),
)?;
let path = resolve_weight_query(
    "qwen3-0.6b",
    &DiscoverOpts::default().with_prefer_quant("Q4_K_M"),
)?;
```

## MXFP4 encoder

[`mxfp4_pack`](src/mxfp4_pack.rs) is rlx's f32 → MXFP4 **encoder** — E2M1 nibbles
plus a per-group E8M0 scale. Every other MXFP4 path in the tree is consume-side,
written for checkpoints that ship already quantized (mlx-community, Kimi); this
is what lets an ordinary bf16/f32 HF checkpoint drive the same packed kernels,
for ~8x less arena.

```rust
use rlx_models_core::mxfp4_pack::{GROUP_SIZE, quantize_rows};

// A `[out, in]` HF weight — the contraction runs along the last dim.
let q = quantize_rows(&weight, out_features, in_features, GROUP_SIZE);
compiled.set_param_typed("w.codes", &q.codes, DType::U8);
compiled.set_param_typed("w.scales", q.scales_e8m0(), DType::U8);   // dense op
// ...or `q.scales_bf16()` for the grouped MoE op — see below.
```

**The two consuming ops disagree on how the scale operand is typed, and the
mismatch is silent** (both are the right byte count):

| op | scale param | contents |
|---|---|---|
| `Op::DequantMatMul` (dense) | `U8 [n, groups]` | raw E8M0 bytes |
| `Op::DequantGroupedMatMulMlx` (MoE) | `BF16 [E, n, groups]` | the *decoded* float `2^(b-127)` |

Layout for both is `[E,] N, K` row-major with the contraction along the last
dim, so a stacked expert bank needs **no transpose** — the opposite of the f32
`Op::GroupedMatMul` path.

Group exponents use the smallest `e` with `6·2^e >= amax`, which makes
saturation impossible. (OCP's `floor(log2(amax)) - 2` leaves the group max in
`[4, 8)` and clamps the top quarter of that range, costing up to 25% on the
largest weight in each group.)

`tests/mxfp4_pack_ops.rs` is the gate: it feeds packed bytes to the real ops and
compares against an f32 matmul of the dequantized weight, so a layout
misreading shared between the encoder and its own `dequantize` cannot pass.
[`examples/mxfp4_grouped_bench`](examples/mxfp4_grouped_bench.rs) times the
grouped/dense ops standalone at real MoE shapes — use it before touching any
MXFP4 kernel.

See [`rlx-ling`](../rlx-ling/README.md) for a whole model on this path.

## DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash

`model_type: deepseek_v41`. A different architecture from V4 rather than a
revision, so it has its own modules:

| module | what it holds |
|---|---|
| [`dsv41`] | config + shapes, and the CSA2 sourcing rules (`kv_source_for`, `index_source_for`, `uses_candidates`) |
| [`dsv41_graph`] | prefill and pipeline stages (`build_deepseek_v41_prefill` / `_stage`) |
| [`dsv41_decode`] | single-token decode with a KV cache, plus the host-side `V41DecodeCache` |
| [`dsv41_engram`] | the n-gram hash tables: token map, prime bucket layout, numpy-exact multipliers |
| [`dsv41_vision`] | DeepSeek-ViT (2-D RoPE) + the aligner |
| [`dsv41_dspark`] | the speculative draft head — seed, step, Markov bias, confidence |
| [`dsv41_quant`] | the fp8/fp4 checkpoint reader (three scale layouts) and `DsV41Loader` |

A pipeline stage boundary carries **both** the hidden state and the
Hyper-Connection pre-mix, because V4.1 threads the mix forward across blocks; a
boundary that dropped it would silently restart from the one-hot mix. Stage
splits also have to keep each `kv_source_layer` in the same stage as the layers
that read it — `DeepseekV41Spec::kv_source_for` tells you where those runs
start.

### Parity

`tests/dsv41_reference_parity.rs` checks the port against the released
`inference/model.py`, run on CPU with its tilelang kernels transliterated to
torch. Parameters are drawn from a name-keyed PRNG both sides reproduce, so the
fixtures carry only shapes and outputs. Every stage matches to 2e-7 relative;
decode reproduces prefill token for token and a split stage reproduces the
single-shot run.

`cargo run -p rlx-models-core --example dsv41_bisect` walks the taps stage by
stage against a dump, which is how the port was brought up — point
`RLX_DSV41_REF` at a fuller dump to compare more intermediates, and
`RLX_DSV41_DBG=<stage> RLX_DSV41_DBGLAYER=<n>` cuts the graph short at one of
them (`engram`, `comp`, `compkv`, `topk`, `attn`, `ffn`, `block`).

### Real weights without the 510 GB

Two tests reach the actual checkpoint without downloading it.

`tensor_manifest_matches_the_real_checkpoint` needs no download at all: a 15 KB
inventory distilled from the 48 shard headers pins all **96,085** tensors —
name, dtype, shape, and that every quantized one's scale resolves to one of the
three layouts — against [`DeepseekV41Spec::expected_tensors`]. It checks both
directions, so a subsystem the port forgot surfaces as an unexplained tensor.

Three more need ~300 MB of range-fetched tensors (a safetensors header gives each
tensor's byte range, so nothing else is downloaded):

* `real_layer_attention_matches_reference` runs the port's own `DsV41Loader` and
  attention over real fp8 bytes at 160 tokens — past `sliding_window`, so the
  window evicts — for layer 0 (sliding-window only) **and** layer 2 (a KV *and*
  index source, so the compressor, the index keys and the YaRN-scaled compressed
  RoPE all run). Agreement is 7.5e-7 relative.
* `dequant_matches_reference_on_real_bytes` decodes one real tensor per scale
  layout **exactly**: FP8 tiles, FP4 nibble pairs, and — the trap — 64 rows of
  the 384-million-row Engram table, which is FP8 but row-wise scaled.
* `engram_token_map_matches_the_real_tokenizer` collapses the real 129,280-token
  vocab and must land on exactly **99092**, the constant every Engram hash
  multiplier is derived from.

See `scripts/dsv41_ref/README.md`; set `RLX_DSV41_WEIGHTS` to run them, otherwise
each checks its committed digest and skips.

### Backends

`prefill_matches_reference_on_all_backends` runs the whole stack on every device
the build can reach — `cargo test -p rlx-models-core --features metal,mlx`.
Bringing it up on Metal and MLX found one bug in each (both upstream in `../rlx`,
both affecting V4 as well; see the changelog), which is the argument for running
it: a CPU-only port is a port that has not been tested.

`examples/dsv41_bisect` also takes `RLX_DSV41_DEVICE=metal|mlx|gpu` and then
compares that backend against CPU at every tap, so a backend divergence can be
bisected without any reference dump. `examples/dsv41_rope_probe` and
`examples/dsv41_topk_probe` isolate the two ops that broke, against a host
reference.

Full end-to-end generation stays `WiredDeferred` — that needs the whole 510 GB.

## Distributed inference (multi-node)

Run one model split across several machines when no single host has the RAM for
the whole checkpoint. The bridge in [`distributed_bridge`](src/distributed_bridge.rs)
plugs `rlx-models-core` decoders into the model-agnostic [`rlx-distributed`](../../../rlx/crates/core/rlx-distributed)
pipeline: each node builds and serves only its own layer range, and stages
exchange just the hidden state over TCP.

| API | Role |
|-----|------|
| [`StructureLoader`](src/distributed_bridge.rs) | Build a stage from tensor **shapes only** (peak RAM = one tensor), deferring the large packed weights — no full arena load |
| [`ManifestParamSource`](src/distributed_bridge.rs) | Re-stream each stage's weight shard from the checkpoint at compile time, keyed by checkpoint name |
| [`run_decoder_pipeline_local`](src/distributed_bridge.rs) | In-process multi-stage pipeline (parity check against single-node) |

Streaming the structure first and re-fetching weights per stage avoids the 2×
arena-load peak, so a node's resident memory tracks *its layers*, not the model:
DeepSeek-V4-Flash (~111 GB on disk, 43 layers) runs across three heterogeneous
nodes at **25.5 GB total resident** (≤12 GB on any one node).

### Config-driven cluster runner

[`examples/dsv4_cluster.rs`](examples/dsv4_cluster.rs) is a full coordinator +
worker binary. One TOML ([`dsv4_cluster.toml`](examples/dsv4_cluster.toml))
describes the model and nodes; the coordinator probes each node's hardware,
plans a RAM-balanced layer split, launches the remote workers over SSH, drives a
forward pass, and prints a per-node timing/resident monitor. Each node keeps its
own `device` / `precision` / `kv_cache`.

```bash
# addresses, `~/.ssh/config` aliases, and ckpt paths are placeholders — edit dsv4_cluster.toml
cargo run --release -p rlx-models-core --example dsv4_cluster -- \
  --config dsv4_cluster.toml \
  --model-dir /path/to/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-2bit-DQ \
  --ids 0,671,6102,294,8760,344
```

**Device notes** (heterogeneous placement): a small-VRAM discrete GPU can OOM or
destabilize its driver on a large managed/oversubscribed stage — the native CPU
path is more stable there; and a backend that host-falls-back the model's
unsupported ops runs *far* slower than the native CPU executor, so prefer CPU
over a GPU that can't run the ops natively. Set each node's `device` accordingly.
