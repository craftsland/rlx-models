//! Host-side generation loop for Qwen3.
//!
//! This is the **naive** generator: each `step()` rebuilds the prefill
//! graph for the full token history and runs it from scratch
//! (O(N²) compute over N generated tokens). The API is shaped to
//! match the upcoming KV-cache version exactly so callers don't have
//! to change anything when the cached path lands — only the internal
//! implementation swaps.
//!
//! Why ship the naive version first:
//!   - Establishes the public API contract before the IR/kernel
//!     changes that the cached version needs land.
//!   - Lets you run end-to-end generation against a real checkpoint
//!     today and validate the prefill graph is numerically correct.
//!   - Provides a reference baseline for the cached version's own
//!     numerical-parity test (cached vs recompute must match).
