//! **Kev** — small Jev-like *System One* decision models, native in RLX.
//!
//! A decision model takes one document (the **state**) plus a set of typed
//! questions and returns a calibrated probability distribution for each, in a
//! single forward pass. It does not generate text. Ported from
//! [jaredpalmer/kev](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/kev), which reimplements
//! the architecture reverse-engineered from TypeSafe's hosted Jev.
//!
//! ```text
//! state  ──► Qwen3.5 backbone (+ merged rank-16 LoRA) ──► hidden
//!                                                          │
//! question k:  <q> instr <opt> a </opt> <opt> b </opt> <decide>
//!                              │                 │          │
//!                              └──── pointer head ──────────┘  ──► p(a), p(b)
//! ```
//!
//! # What the pieces are
//!
//! | module | role |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`api`] | `POST /v1/systemone` shapes, `render`, typed answers |
//! | [`encode`] | packing a record into tokens; the delimiter protocol |
//! | [`pointer`] | the readout head and its calibration temperature |
//! | [`lora`] | reading a peft adapter and folding it into base weights |
//! | [`weights`] | HF Qwen3.5 base + merged adapter → `Qwen35Weights` |
//! | [`checkpoint`] | a run directory: `head.pt`, adapter, tokenizer |
//! | [`model`] | the forward pass and the compiled-shape policy |
//!
//! # Scope of this port
//!
//! Implemented: the **row form** — one causal row per question, which is what
//! kev itself uses on Qwen3.5 because the Gated DeltaNet layers ignore
//! attention masks. Isolation is exact by construction.
//!
//! Not implemented: the **packed form** (all questions in one sequence under
//! an additive block-causal mask). It is only reachable on attention-only
//! Qwen3-generation bases, and it needs `MaskKind::Bias` threaded through the
//! `rlx-qwen35` prefill graph, which currently exposes a mask input on the
//! cache/verify path only. [`encode`] already produces the `seg` / `opt`
//! vectors it would need.
//!
//! Weights are loaded as dense f32. Kev-0.8B is comfortable on a laptop;
//! 4B and 9B want a large-memory host until a packed or bf16 path exists.
