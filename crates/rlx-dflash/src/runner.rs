//! The DFlash propose/verify loop.
//!
//! ## Who owns what
//!
//! [`DflashDrafter`] owns the three compiled graphs and the drafter's KV cache
//! and knows nothing about any particular target. [`DflashTarget`] is the small
//! surface a target model must expose: run one verification pass and hand back
//! per-slot distributions *and* the residual taps those slots produced.
//! [`DflashLoop`] drives the two.
//!
//! Keeping the taps in the same return value as the distributions is not
//! incidental — the target's verification forward is exactly the forward that
//! produces the taps for the tokens it just committed, so asking for them
//! separately would mean running the target twice.
//!
//! ## One round
//!
//! ```text
//!   drafter: [anchor, MASK, …] --decode--> draft tokens (+ slate dists)
//!   target:  [anchor, draft…]  --verify--> per-slot dists + per-slot taps
//!   accept:  maximal coupling over the slates -> accepted prefix + 1 bonus
//!   inject:  taps for slots 0..=accepted  ->  drafter KV cache
//!   next anchor = the bonus token (its taps arrive with the NEXT verify)
//! ```
//!
//! Slot 0 of the verify pass is the *previous* anchor: it was in the noise
//! block, so its KV never came from the injection path and it is still missing
//! from the drafter's cache. Injecting `0..=accepted` closes that gap exactly.
//!
//! ## Shapes are fixed up front
//!
//! Every graph is compiled in [`DflashDrafter::new`], never mid-generation:
//! the encoder and injection run at a fixed chunk width (short batches are
//! zero-padded, which is safe because injection is per-position), and the
//! decoder gets one graph per power-of-two cache bucket with the slack hidden
//! by `attn_mask`. A graph keyed on the exact `past_seq` would recompile once
//! per accepted token.
//!
//! ## Two limits that come out of that choice
//!
//! **Sliding-window attention is not supported past the window.** Padding the
//! cache breaks the identity `key index == absolute position` (real keys sit at
//! `0..n_past`, the block at `cap..cap+block`), and rlx derives a positional
//! mask's origin from `k_seq - q_seq`. So `MaskKind::SlidingWindow` would
//! measure the window from the wrong place, and a `[batch, key_len]` value mask
//! cannot express a per-query window at all. Inside the window the padding mask
//! is exact and the two agree, so [`DflashDrafter::new`] refuses a
//! `max_context` larger than the checkpoint's window rather than quietly
//! attending outside it.
//!
//! **Shared params are held once per bucket.** `token_embd.weight` and
//! `output.weight` come from the target and are uploaded into every decoder
//! graph, so N buckets cost N copies. On a 248k-vocab target that is ~5 GB
//! each; set `min_bucket == max_context` for a single bucket when memory-bound.
