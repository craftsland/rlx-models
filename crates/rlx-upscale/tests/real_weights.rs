//! Real-checkpoint tests.
//!
//! These need weights, which this repository does not ship. Point
//! `RLX_UPSCALE_MODELS` at a directory of `.pth` files and they run over every
//! one; without it they skip.
//!
//! ```text
//! RLX_UPSCALE_MODELS=~/models cargo test -p rlx-upscale --test real_weights -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! # What "correct" means without a PyTorch oracle
//!
//! Running the reference is not possible here, so the check is a property the
//! *task* guarantees rather than a golden output: **downscaling a ×N result by
//! N must line up with the input**. A transposed kernel, a mis-ordered pixel
//! shuffle or a botched reparameterization all move energy across the image,
//! and that survives downscaling.
//!
//! The metric is **correlation**, not PSNR, and the distinction is the whole
//! point. Two kinds of model are in scope:
//!
//! * *Efficient SR* models trained on clean bicubic degradation reproduce the
//!   input almost exactly — SPANV2 round-trips at 42 dB.
//! * *Restoration* models are trained to *change* the image: remove compression
//!   artifacts, re-saturate, denoise. A 2× anime SPAN round-trips at 12 dB
//!   while producing a visibly better picture than the one that scores 42.
//!
//! A ×1 model has nothing to downscale and is compared to the input directly.
//!
//! PSNR cannot tell the second kind from a broken port; correlation can, since
//! it is invariant to the per-channel gain and offset a restoration model
//! applies but is destroyed by any spatial scrambling. PSNR is still printed,
//! because a sudden change in it is worth looking at.
//!
//! Measured on release checkpoints, for calibration:
//!
//! | model | r | PSNR |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | SPANV2 ×4 (`team22_spanv2_c2`, NTIRE 2026 winner) | 0.9998 | 50.6 dB |
//! | RealPLKSR ×2 dysample+layernorm (`2xPublic_…_real`) | 0.9963 | 38.5 dB |
//! | Compact ×4 (`realesr-general-x4v3`) | 0.9977 | 38.3 dB |
//! | SPAN ×2 anime restoration (`2xHFA2kSPAN`) | 0.9496 | 13.8 dB |
