//! **OmniSR** — Omni Self-Attention SR (CVPR 2023).
//!
//! A MaxViT-shaped block applied to super-resolution: every `OSA_Block`
//! alternates attention that is *local* with attention that is *global*, and
//! interleaves channel attention with both.
//!
//! ```text
//!   MBConv                      spatial mixing, cheap
//!   block attention   + FFN     ws×ws contiguous tiles
//!   channel attention + FFN     over channels, tokens contracted
//!   grid attention    + FFN     ws×ws tiles strided across the image
//!   channel attention + FFN     (grid grouping)
//! ```
//!
//! # Block and grid partitions are not the same permutation
//!
//! The reference writes them as two `einops` patterns that differ only in the
//! order of a pair of factors:
//!
//! ```text
//!   block:  b d (x w1) (y w2) -> b x y w1 w2 d     window = 8 adjacent pixels
//!   grid:   b d (w1 x) (w2 y) -> b x y w1 w2 d     window = every (H/8)-th pixel
//! ```
//!
//! Both produce the same *shape*, so getting them the wrong way round is a
//! silent error: the network still runs, the output is still an image, and it
//! is simply attending over the wrong pixels. They are therefore built by two
//! separate functions with the factor order spelled out, and
//! [`tests::grid_and_block_partitions_differ`] pins that they disagree.
//!
//! # The checkpoints carry profiler droppings
//!
//! Released OmniSR weights were saved after a `thop` profiling pass, so roughly
//! three quarters of the tensors in the file are `total_ops` / `total_params`
//! scalars registered as buffers on every module. They are stripped on load —
//! see [`crate::weights::strip_profiler_buffers`].
