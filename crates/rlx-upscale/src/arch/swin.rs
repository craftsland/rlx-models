//! The Swin lineage: **SwinIR**, **HAT** and **DRCT**.
//!
//! All three are the same backbone — shifted-window attention over a
//! convolutional stem, in residual groups each closed by a convolution — and
//! differ only in what goes inside a group:
//!
//! | | group body | extra per block |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | SwinIR | `depth` Swin blocks | — |
//! | HAT | `depth` blocks + one overlapping-cross-attention block | a channel-attention conv branch |
//! | DRCT | five densely-connected blocks | 1×1 `adjust` after each |
//!
//! # Everything static is precomputed on the host
//!
//! Two tensors dominate the naive implementation and neither depends on the
//! input: the relative-position bias (a *gather* of a learned table through a
//! fixed index) and the shifted-window attention mask (a `0`/`−100` pattern
//! fixed by the tile geometry). At inference the table is frozen, so the gather
//! is performed once at build time in [`rpe_bias`] and injected as a constant.
//! That removes a `Gather` from the hot path of every block and keeps the mask
//! at `[1, nW, 1, N, N]` — broadcast over heads — rather than materializing the
//! `[B·nW, nH, N, N]` bias a fused-attention op would demand. For a 192×192
//! tile with 6 heads and window 16 that is the difference between 590 KB and
//! 340 MB.
//!
//! # Attention is written out, not fused
//!
//! `Op::Attention`'s `MaskKind::Bias` wants a full `[batch, heads, q, k]`
//! tensor, which is exactly the tensor the point above is avoiding. The
//! explicit `q·kᵀ → +bias → softmax → ·v` form broadcasts the two small
//! constants instead, and is what the reference computes anyway.
//!
//! # A note on CPU cost
//!
//! Window partition/reverse swaps two *middle* axes, so it misses rlx-cpu's
//! last-two-axis fast path and falls to the
//! general N-D index walk. There are two per block. This is the main reason
//! tier-2 models want a GPU backend; the tile default is sized accordingly.
